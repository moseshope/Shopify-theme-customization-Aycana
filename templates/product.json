This wealth of biodiversity provides important ecosystem services which contribute to both a healthy natural environment and human wellbeing.<br\/><br\/>Over the past two decades, Peru has emerged as a significant and growing global fruit and vegetable exporter, driven by the advantages of its climate and fertile plains which enable the production of many fruits all year round.<br\/><br\/>Having access to the great biodiversity and fresh produce grown in Peru is a real privilege. However, superfoods, fruits and vegetables can never fully retain all their outstanding natural flavors, aromas, textures or nutrients when frozen which is why AYCANA decided to be based in Peru. It means that we can take full advantage of the potential of Peru’s amazing fresh produce, allowing each fruit or vegetable to be harvested at its optimal maturation point ready for AYCANA to process into next generation dehydrated fruit snacks and premium ingredients.<\/p>","button_link":"","button_label":""}},"newsletter":{"type":"newsletter--newsletter","settings":{"colors":"light","subheading":"","title":"Join our Mailing List","newsletter_description":""}}},"order":["main","judgeme_section_review_widget_5727","fcdd10f8-b15a-4426-bc7c-c589958a788d","product-recommendations","8e6347c6-9694-48c2-aae7-2ab6ddf00a84","7a3cbe62-d0f8-49bf-9a86-ebb7a27eb768","product-description","1668453889b7104286","16684539012776e69e","6e720640-982a-40dc-9c77-2fca32941c93","b69e6274-db84-4478-a775-def5187df346","newsletter"]}
